# SN CMS
## Blog CMS using Next.js, Markdown/GitHub and TypeScript

This is forked from the existing [blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter) plus TypeScript.

The blog posts are retrieved from GitHub accounts as markdown files with front matter support. You can manage your blogs by linking your GitHub account and choosing the source of Blog content.

To create the blog posts we use [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark) and [`remark-html`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-html) to convert the markdown files into an HTML string, and then send it down as a prop to the page. The metadata of every post is handled by [`gray-matter`](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter) and also sent in props to the page.

## How to use

## Deploy your own

### More on using `create-next-app`

Execute [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bootstrap the example:

```bash
npx create-next-app --example blog-starter-typescript blog-starter-typescript-app
# or
yarn create next-app --example blog-starter-typescript blog-starter-typescript-app
```

Your blog should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! If it doesn't work, post on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/upadhyayprakash/sn-cms/issues).

# Notes

This blog-starter-typescript uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). To control the generated stylesheet's filesize, this example uses Tailwind CSS' v1.4 [`purge` option](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/#removing-unused-css) to remove unused CSS.
